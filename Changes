=head1 CHANGES 

=head1 ver 0.04

* changed s/\\240\\240/\\020\\020/ in html2ps perl script, \\240 was
  producing some Euro chars on DOS platforms.

* added s/\\201(.*?)\\202/\($1\)/g to solve the weird presentation of
  () on windows in the bookmarks section (Gunther Birzienks)

* modified the Pod::HtmlPsPdf::Html::process_figure() to accept any
  images and automatically extract the figure index. Note that it
  breaks the previous syntax. So if you were relying on this feature
  what you should do is this:

  perl -pi -e 's|=figure\s+(\S+)|=figure fig$1.gif|' filename(s)

  on all files that has this pod tag. And you will get the id coverted
  into a real filename. See the docs/extended_pod.pod for the info
  about the new syntax.

* Improved the handling of the slides generation mode. Now you can do
  2 levels identation. See Pod::HtmlPsPdf::Chapter doc for more info.

=head1 ver 0.03 -- Mon Nov 13 00:54:07 CET 2000

* Fixed the linking between different pages from different directories
  on different levels. which has sprung into existence a new template
  variable which always makes the path correct relative to the
  absolute root of the documentation project [DOC_ROOT]. See the
  sample templates for an example of this template placeholder usage.

* Rewrote the title parsing in pod, to parse correctly the standard
  POD document's first section (which is used for title). (The
  proprietary simplified syntax

  =head1 This is a title

  works as well.

* Added the slides mode (-e): If you turn the slides mode on, it
  automatically turns the -i (C<*> preprocessing) mode and does a page
  break before each =head tag.

* s/blue/#eeeeee/ for the code side bar (is supposed to use less ink
  on the printers, while still having a prominent line). (Thanks to T.J. Yang)

=head1 ver 0.02 -- Sat Aug 26 18:34:16 CEST 2000

* now handling correctly internal links between htmls for source pods
  with subdirs. (Next|Prev)

* An Edge problem was fixed. Now the html generated for the first file
  in the list of sources doesn't have the 'Prev' link and the
  generated for the last one in the list, doesn't have the 'Next'
  link.

=head1 ver 0.01 -- Sun Aug 20 01:29:55 CEST 2000
